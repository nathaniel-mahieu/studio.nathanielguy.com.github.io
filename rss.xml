    <description>NathanielGuy Studio: this is a portfolio of photography taken by me, NathanielGuy. I allow you to think of my subjects in an alternate way thriugh my photos, which is one of my favorite aspects of all art. My photographic style has moved from nature and macro to capturing people, moments, and emotion. I hope you enjoy my photos!</description>

This was my first finished senior photo, and I like it a lot.

We went out and took photos in quite a few places, by the time we arrived at the train tracks the sky was overcast.  That overcast sky softened his face, adding to the beauty of the photo, and some of the light was bouncing off the white gravel and into his eyes, lighting them up a bit.   I must say, I love my 85mm prime, that thing is sharp and a great lens.  Great for portraits.

I like the photo for a couple reasons, its sharpness around the eyes is one of them.  Also, there are two ways to look at the photo.  If you glance at it the train tracks are a prominent part of the image, but if you concentrate on the image they seem to fall away, leaving only Kyle.  I love it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The outline of the butterfly can be seen against the sky and the green of the leaves is pleasant against the blue of the air.  The light on the leaves gives the the photo a warm sunny mood.  The light source was almost above the butterfly which caused the leaves to catch the light and the butterfly to be dark.  This photo appeals to me because butterflies are seen as light loving and this one is in the shadows. It is quite a simple photo.  The leaves of the tree also frame the butterfly with shadows.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Most of the interest in the photo comes from the angles of the shot and the kids.  The depth the tree and leaves create is also nice.  Because most of the natural light in the photo was coming from above, through the leaves, I lit the foreground with the on camera flash. The result is much more appealing than I expected.  the flash kept the image contrast, for the most part, and kept the lighting level.    Another this i like about this photo is is the colors.  They basically include white blue and green.  It really isolates the skin tones and brings your eyes to the face.  I like it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The portrait can really be broken down into its parts, each representing a portion of this persons personality.  Farthest is the confederate flag, not representing racism, but a since of pride and heritage.  The caution tape alludes to danger, and the risks of exploiting his freedom.  Knowing this person, I can say that he is very free.  Second to the front of focus is the person himself, looking onward to what awaits him, ready to tackle his future.  He, though, is not the focus element.  It is a tattoo on his back.  This tattoo represents his namesake and his faith in God.  Deriving from it, courage like a Lyon.  I am privileged to know this man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Remnants of his birthday cake still sit in front of him, seeming to remind him that his day has past, and he is another year older.  It strikes me odd that a child could have this expression on his face at his birthday.  One assumes all children to be bursting with joy on their special day.  That fact is what makes this photo interesting to me.

The atmosphere is great, the single light of the candle illuminates his face in a very sublime and thoughtful way.  It brings out the skin tones and sets the mood for the entire picture.

Though I did not stay until they had finished I am betting on the sunflower.  The photo appeals to me for a couple of reasons. First, the mood of the photo is happy and slightly funny.  The size of the sunflower compared to the bee adds a slightly entertaining touch to the photo.  The empty space on the bee side makes the honey bee look even smaller in comparison.  Also, the sunflower looks to have a bit of an attitude towards the bee, which I like.  The photo also captures something that you do not see every day; A bee in mid flight with decent detail.  The photo has pleasant colors, the yellow lightening the mood even more, and wonderful bokeh.  This blurring isolates the two subjects in their contest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The photo has pleasant colors, the yellow lightening the mood even more, and wonderful bokeh.  This blurring isolates the two subjects in their contest.&lt;/p&gt;</media:text>

The old has passed away; behold, the new has come. 2Cor. 5:17'  Less on the religious implications of the verse and more on the passing of old, and budding of new.  You can literally see the vibrance and new life ready to burst from their bundled cage.  These two sunflowers illustrate a point of life in a very beautiful way, and there is much more you could take from this, but I will leave that thought to you.  The photo features an older sunflower, just past its prime, bokeh'd into the background.  It is glinting with the midday summer light, and those highlights definitely add to the uplifting feeling brought by this picture.  The head of this first sunflower is bowed down, as if to allow the beauty of the youthful sunflower to show in full.  The main subject of the photo is a not yet bloomed sunflower, just waiting for the right moment to bring its full sunflower beauty into the world.  The green tint of its future, warm yellow petals convey youth and vitality.  This can not even be contained by the sunflower as, already, one petal has sprung from its cage. Sunflowers make beautiful similes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There is a vast amazing world around us and we need to stop and enjoy it.  In this photo there are many things to take in.  The first is the vastness of the world, there is so much space, and the subject is reveling in that thought.  The open sky, and open road, both lend themselves to this thought.  There is also the thought of the future, our journey.  The subject is not moving, but overjoyed just to be on the road.  Its obvious that the subject does not care where the end of his journey is, but that he is on one.  There is a graduation, from dark to light, as the road travels onward.  It relates to the past moving towards the future.  There is no hope in the past, only hope in that which is to come.  The dreamy, soft look of the photo adds to its appeal to thoughtfulness.  -Me&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This was my first day of shooting with my new camera, a Digital Rebel XT and I loved every second of it. The camera preserved so much detail in the photos.  You can see the groom here, leading the bride back into the church.  The main light was behind them, but mostly blocked by the people around, and the light bouncing off the wall was enough to grab this shot.  The small aperture isolated the two, in their blissful moment.  All I can say is congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To me, there is a lot to this picture.  In it I see beauty as well as an emotional tie.  The beauty lies in the simplicity and the play between light and dark.  The lighthouse itself is pretty and the lights and walkway create an enjoyable scene.

The emotional ties, though, are what make the heart of this photo.  You can see the battle of light and dark in the scene, going on all around.  The walkway is representative of a path through life, and though we walk through darkness at times, you can always see the end.  The person at the bottom is only beginning the journey towards the lighthouse, a shining beacon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This snowscape offers a look at the shadows, textures, and wildlife of the post snow morning.  The photo offers purity in the blown out white, also offering the visualization of bright light, and the feeling of something uplifting.  The shadows cast by the items in the snow, the mounds of snow, and the snow its self, add the interest to the photo.  The mounds were created by the snow filtering through slats in the deck, leaving indentations.  They are accented by the shadows they cast, and the light they catch.  Another main aspect of the photo are the bird tracks seen in the snow at the forefront of the photo.  This subtle addition completes the photo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are three main aspects of this photo that I like.  The first is the simplicity, in the colors, and shadows.  The orange int he grass contrasts with the cool blues of the snow and the shadows contrast with the light.  Secondly the sharpness of this photo is wonderful, leaving the subject to draw your attention, even though there is only a  blade of frozen glass.  My final, and favorite aspect of this photo is the dreamy feel to the focus of the background.  The softness adds to the ice plating the blades and the sparkle of the snow is icing on the cake.  Even as the subject is the in focus blade, the background is even more fulfilling to view, while not detracting or making the photo too busy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The colors all cluster around orange, so much that it is nearly monochromatic.  The silhouettes of a fence and a strand of barbed wire are the main focal points of the photo, and the colors add interest.  As post-processing a slight soft focus was applied, adding to the dreamy feel of the photo. I should note, as I took this picture I nearly got frostbite from the bitter cold of our winter.  Quite a contrast to the warmth of the photo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I disagree, and you can see why.  At Cornerstone Music Festival there was a band, two red heads and a guy in a blue jacket, all with red guitars, a blue drumset, and a lead singer dressed in grey.  The colors were wonderful, and so was the music.  While I was watching I saw that one of the guitarists had a rainbow of colors on the ends of hist strings.  It provided a perfect opportunity for a photo.  I love the idea of different notes having different color, and this demonstrated it wonderfully.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The knobs made the perfect candidate to show off the depth of the photo, and the colors on them add to the picture.  I think this show was  one which had some technical sound difficulties; So despite the prominant orange labeling, the operator couldn't figure out what to do.  Maybe the bright orange was distracting.  The roll of tape left is reminescent of the labeling itself. It tells a story&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They actually didnt smell too horribly at the time, and weren't dusty from the roads yet.  The color is brought out thanks to the sun and lack of dust.  Cornerstone porta-potties are definitely the most colorful I have seen.  They were lined up and gave many campers relief that week.  These particular bathrooms were behind merch tent 3, and had not been covered in band posters.  Because they were lined up, the leaning one adds a bit of interest to the picture, the lines add some movement, and all together liven up the photo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <media:title>Colorful Porta Potties</media:title>
        <media:description>These porta potties were found at Cornerstone Music Festival in Illinois 2006.  They actually didnt smell too horribly at the time, and weren't dusty from the roads yet.  The color is brought out thanks to the sun and lack of dust.  Cornerstone porta-potties are definitely the most colorful I have seen.  They were lined up and gave many campers relief that week.  These particular bathrooms were behind merch tent 3, and had not been covered in band posters.  Because they were lined up, the leaning one adds a bit of interest to the picture, the lines add some movement, and all together liven up the photo.</media:description>

The photo represents the life the sun gives and our growth from it, from something small into ourselfs.  It also illustrates our connection with nature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Worms left their marks in the bark in the form of intricate designs.  The texture of the wood is soft leaving the lines in the wood contrasting that texture.  These worms were definately quite the artists. The greyscale nature of the photo adds to the effect of the texture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The primary subject of white flowers bring the contrast of light versus dark to the photo.  The theme of flowers is carried into the picture and life and growth are conveyed to the viewer.  The yellow in the background adds to the color contrast of the shot with the green.  &lt;/p&gt;</media:text>

My friend here represents reaching for your goals, climbing the hard path to the top.  The photo doesn't necessarily convey that message as much as I would like, but it is still a pleasant shot.  Reminds me of fall and hard work.  The tree vanishes into the distance leaving the boots in the main view of the photo.

The depth and angle of this picture make it interesting.  The boot scales the tree as I get under and snap a photo.  The pure blue and browns blend pleasantly.  I don't like, though, the busyness of the branches.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Spring rainbows and fall leaves combined lend to this photo an interesting atmosphere.  The draw of the photo comes from the over exaggerated colors.  They bring forth thoughts of spring flowers or a rainbow, as well as the colorful foliage of fall. There is also an interesting vantage point, catching the light on the blades of grass and the rolling hill of the yard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The monochromatic overtone of the photo leads you to notice more of the textures of the glove and shapes of the snowflakes.  View larger for more detail.  It is amazing how each snowflake actually has it's own shape.  I had not realized this until I saw it with my own eyes.  The snowflakes crystalline structures can actually be seen in this picture, which makes it amazing.

These did not stick around for very long, as my warmth caused them to melt, but the photo catches their unique beauty.  It reminds me of that winter every time i see the photo.  The flakes actually look similar to those you would make out of paper during winter, and the ones people draw.  Before seeing this I thought that the illustrations of flakes were simply exaggerations, but they really are that beautiful in real life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The flowers dainty beauty is captured in this close up.  The shadows that play on the petals and the colors make the picture stand out.  The crisp focus throughout the picture and the aperture falloff are appealing to me.  These little plants are growing by the thousands when spring rolls around each year.  Each gets a few of these little buds, but only a couple of them survive to become trees.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Spoon Full Of Sky</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://studio.nathanielguy.com/a_spoon_full_of_sky" title="A Spoon Full Of Sky"&gt;&lt;img src="http://studio.nathanielguy.com/thumbnails/a_spoon_full_of_sky_thumbnail.jpg" alt="A Spoon Full Of Sky" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 style="font-size:larger;"&gt;A Spoon Full Of Sky&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sky, trees, and house caught in a spoon.  The backdrop to this photo is the new deck we built that summer.  The red of the deck makes the blue and greens in the spoon pop.  If you look very closely you can see me in parts of the handle (not very well though).  The light plays in the bowl of the spoon just like water would.

A beautiful summer day created the lighting and contrast to make this picture so appealing.  I had just finished a strawberry yogurt and licked my spoon clean when the idea for the photo hit me.  I got my grandparent's point and shoot digital camera and took a couple shots.  Luckily for me one turned out, and I love it.

The idea is quite thought provoking aswell, how would the world look through the eyes of a spoon?  This photo marked my entrance into the world of arts.  In the past I had been a linear math person.  I am very thankful for the arts bring me much intrest.

I hope you like my photo!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A beautiful summer day created the lighting and contrast to make this picture so appealing.  I had just finished a strawberry yogurt and licked my spoon clean when the idea for the photo hit me.  I got my grandparent's point and shoot digital camera and took a couple shots.  Luckily for me one turned out, and I love it.

The idea is quite thought provoking aswell, how would the world look through the eyes of a spoon?  This photo marked my entrance into the world of arts.  In the past I had been a linear math person.  I am very thankful for the arts bring me much intrest.

I hope you like my photo!</media:description>

The backdrop to this photo is the new deck we built that summer.  The red of the deck makes the blue and greens in the spoon pop.  If you look very closely you can see me in parts of the handle (not very well though).  The light plays in the bowl of the spoon just like water would.
