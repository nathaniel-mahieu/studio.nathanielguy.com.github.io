 <meta name="description" content="Glosoli.  There is a vast amazing world around us and we need to stop and enjoy it.  In this photo there are many things to take in.  The first is the vastness of the world, there is so much space, and the subject is reveling in that thought.  The open sky, and open road, both lend themselves to this thought.

Its obvious that the subject does not care where the end of his journey is, but that he is on one.  There is a graduation, from dark to light, as the road travels onward.  It relates to the past moving towards the future.  There is no hope in the past, only hope in that which is to come.  The dreamy, soft look of the photo adds to its appeal to thoughtfulness.  -Me. ">
