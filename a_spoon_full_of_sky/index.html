A beautiful summer day created the lighting and contrast to make this picture so appealing.  I had just finished a strawberry yogurt and licked my spoon clean when the idea for the photo hit me.  I got my grandparent's point and shoot digital camera and took a couple shots.  Luckily for me one turned out, and I love it.

The idea is quite thought provoking aswell, how would the world look through the eyes of a spoon?  This photo marked my entrance into the world of arts.  In the past I had been a linear math person.  I am very thankful for the arts bring me much intrest.

I hope you like my photo!. ">
