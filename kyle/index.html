 <meta name="description" content="Marking my official foray into portraiture, I give you Kyle.  This was my first finished senior photo, and I like it a lot.

We went out and took photos in quite a few places, by the time we arrived at the train tracks the sky was overcast.  That overcast sky softened his face, adding to the beauty of the photo, and some of the light was bouncing off the white gravel and into his eyes, lighting them up a bit.

I like the photo for a couple reasons, its sharpness around the eyes is one of them.  Also, there are two ways to look at the photo.  If you glance at it the train tracks are a prominent part of the image, but if you concentrate on the image they seem to fall away, leaving only Kyle.  I love it.. ">

Marking my official foray into portraiture, I give you Kyle.  This was my first finished senior photo, and I like it a lot.

That overcast sky softened his face, adding to the beauty of the photo, and some of the light was bouncing off the white gravel and into his eyes, lighting them up a bit.   I must say, I love my 85mm prime, that thing is sharp and a great lens.  Great for portraits.

I like the photo for a couple reasons, its sharpness around the eyes is one of them.  Also, there are two ways to look at the photo.  If you glance at it the train tracks are a prominent part of the image, but if you concentrate on the image they seem to fall away, leaving only Kyle.  I love it.
